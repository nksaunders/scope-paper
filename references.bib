	abstract={HAT-P-20b is a giant metal-rich exoplanet orbiting a metal-rich star. We analyze two secondary eclipses of the planet in each of the 3.6 and 4.5 μ m bands of Warm Spitzer . We have developed a simple, powerful, and radically different method to correct the intra-pixel effect for Warm Spitzer data, which we call pixel-level decorrelation (PLD). PLD corrects the intra-pixel effect very effectively, but without explicitly using—or even measuring—the fluctuations in the apparent position of the stellar image. We illustrate and validate PLD using synthetic and real data and comparing the results to previous analyses. PLD can significantly reduce or eliminate red noise in Spitzer secondary eclipse photometry, even for eclipses that have proven to be intractable using other methods. Our successful PLD analysis of four HAT-P-20b eclipses shows a best-fit blackbody temperature of 1134 ± 29 K, indicating inefficient longitudinal transfer of heat, but lacking evidence for strong molecular absorption. We find sufficient evidence for variability in the 4.5 μ m band that the eclipses should be monitored at that wavelength by Spitzer , and this planet should be a high priority for James Webb Space Telescope spectroscopy. All four eclipses occur about 35 minutes after orbital phase 0.5, indicating a slightly eccentric orbit. A joint fit of the eclipse and transit times with extant RV data yields ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/805/2/132/apj512285ieqn3.gif] {$e{\rm cos} \omega =0.01352_{-0.00057}^{+0.00054}$} and establishes the small eccentricity of the orbit to high statistical confidence. HAT-P-20b is another excellent candidate for orbital evolution via Kozai migration or other three-body mechanisms.}

	abstract={With the loss of a second reaction wheel, resulting in the inability to point continuously and stably at the same field of view, the NASA Kepler satellite recently entered a new mode of observation known as the K2 mission. The data from this redesigned mission present a specific challenge; the targets systematically drift in position on an ?6 hr timescale, inducing a significant instrumental signal in the photometric time series?this greatly impacts the ability to detect planetary signals and perform asteroseismic analysis. Here we detail our version of a reduction pipeline for K2 target pixel data, which automatically?defines masks for all targets in a given frame; extracts the target?s flux?and position time series; corrects the time series based on the apparent movement on the CCD (either in 1D or 2D), combined with the correction of instrumental and/or planetary signals via the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Operations Center (KASOC) filter, thus rendering the time series ready for asteroseismic analysis; computes power spectra for all targets;?and identifies potential contaminations between targets. From a test of our pipeline on a sample of targets from the K2 campaign 0, the recovery of data for multiple targets increases the amount of potential light curves by a factor of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/30/apj513321ieqn1.gif] {$\geqslant 10$} .

  abstract={We present evidence that spots imaged using astronomical CCDs do not exactly scale with flux: bright spots tend to be broader than faint ones, using the same illumination pattern. We measure that the linear size of spots or stars, of typical size 3 to 4 pixels FWHM, increase linearly with their flux by up to 2 % over the full CCD dynamic range. This brighter-fatter effect affects both deep-depleted and thinned CCD sensors. We propose that this effect is a direct consequence of the distortions of the drift electric field sourced by charges accumulated within the CCD during the exposure and experienced by forthcoming light-induced charges in the same exposure. The pixel boundaries then become slightly dynamical: overfilled pixels become increasingly smaller than their neighbors, so that bright star sizes, measured in number of pixels, appear larger than those of faint stars. This interpretation of the brighter-fatter effect implies that pixels in flat-fields should exhibit statistical correlations, sourced by Poisson fluctuations, that we indeed directly detect. We propose to use the measured correlations in flat-fields to derive how pixel boundaries shift under the influence of a given charge pattern, which allows us in turn to predict how star shapes evolve with flux. We show that, within the precision of our tests, we are able to quantitatively relate the correlations of flat-field pixels and the broadening of stars with flux. This physical model of the brighter-fatter effect also explains the commonly observed phenomenon that the spatial variance of CCD flat-fields increases less rapidly than their average.}

 abstract = {ABSTRACT.The Kepler Mission is searching for Earth-size planets orbiting solar-like stars by simultaneously observing >160,000>160,000 stars to detect sequences of transit events in the photometric light curves. The Combined Differential Photometric Precision (CDPP) is the metric that defines the ease with which these weak terrestrial transit signatures can be detected. An understanding of CDPP is invaluable for evaluating the completeness of the Kepler survey and inferring the underlying planet population. This paper describes how the Kepler CDPP is calculated, and introduces tables of rms CDPP on a per-target basis for 3-, 6-, and 12-hr transit durations, which are now available for all Kepler observations. Quarter 3 is the first typical set of observations at the nominal length and completeness for a quarter, from 2009 September 18 to 2009 December 16, and we examine the properties of the rms CDPP distribution for this data set. Finally, we describe how to employ CDPP to calculate target completeness, an important use case.},
